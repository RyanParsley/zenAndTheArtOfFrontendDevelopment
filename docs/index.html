# Zen and the Art of ~~Motorcycle Maintenance~~ Frontend Development:
## An Inquiry into Values

### Ryan Parsley
#### August 23, 2022

???

This presentation will borrow ideas from a book I like. I think it's a good
book with at title that may be a bit misleading. There's scant little about zen
in it and it's not "about" motorcycle maintenance, but motorcycle maintenance is
nice metaphor for the author to tease out over the course of the story. The
subtitle is more telling of what I like about the book.

At it's surface the book is about a road trip, but the narrator indulges in
inner monologue about quality. I'll do my best to not spoil the book as I
shamelessly copy/paste many lines to use as a framing device fore my
presentation on values and quality.

---

> Motorcycle maintenance gets frustrating. Angering. Infuriating. That's what
> makes it interesting.

???

I believe these quotes will be interesting to you weather you've read (or like)
the book. If you have read it, I'd be happy to chat in teams on if you liked it
or not (It seems a bit polarizing) and if you get curious about the book and
decide to read it, I'd like to hear about that too.


Douglass Crockford, author of Javascript the good parts, mentioned "the abyss" in
a presentation. And said No matter how salty/grumpy/cantankerous the dev...
trust that they are an optimist because they keep diving into that abyss of
uncertainty knowing they'll get back out.

# Curiosity

---

> That’s the way the world keeps on happening. Be interested in it.

???

Curiosity is really important.


It would be easy to paraphrase the narrator's stance as "If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself" but I feel the real take away should be "If something is important, you should strive to understand it."

---

> Caring about what you are doing is considered either unimportant or taken for
> granted.

???

A really important moment in Robert's past is a time when he knew little of
maintenance and trusted mechanics to fix his bike as they made a series of
careless mistakes further damaging his bike. 

---

> You follow these little discrepancies long enough and they sometimes open up
> into huge revelations.

???

Probably a good segue for performance.

---
> We are all of us very arrogant and conceited about running down other people’s
> ghosts but just as ignorant and barbaric and superstitious about our own.

???

There's a 

OOP vs Functional... vs procedural for that matter.

---

> The real purpose of the scientific method is to make sure nature hasn’t misled
> you into thinking you know something you actually don’t know.

???

Measure all the things. Performance, user interaction, anything you can to tread
all bits of the gig as an experiment.

# Classical vs Romantic

???

John's handlebars grew loose and he was unable to tighten them. The narrator
recommended an aluminum shim made from a beer can. John refused this advice
"concerned about perception more than efficacy". This is the start of the
narrator discussing  2 realities: artistic appearance and scientific
explanation.

abstract vs concrete.

classical (scientific, rational, reasoning)
romantic (artistic, intuitive, imaginative, inspirational)

I like about this book that extremes are not celebrated. I see people take
personality tests and brag that they're team green or whatever but the point is
to see your bias so you can avoid these pitfalls. Or be aware of how avoid
tricky situations when talking with a coworker who's wired differently than you
are.

# The Knife

???

Phaedrus was hyperrational and this was clearly a character flaw as well as his super power.

The "knife" of analysis cutting ideas into systems to sort/categorize is remarably on point to how we use abstractions and metaphors to write code.

???

Not about testing, but about linting and policies playing out over time.

formly makes sense here.

---

> Quality is just the focal point around which a lot of intellectual furniture
> is getting rearranged.

???

Riff on how there's not one way to build quality software, but patterns are nice
ways to put it on auto-pilot if you don't know any better. Also, you should be
careful to not blindly follow patterns that "don't fit"

You're not going to agree with some of what I say on a subjective or style
level. That's cool. I'm not claiming to be "doing it right", I just have some
ideas that make sense to me as I think about quality.

???

Be aware of js idioms. We're not writing C, even though the dialect is derived
from C.

---

> One thing about pioneers that you don’t hear mentioned is that they are
> invariably, by their nature, mess-makers.

???

Something about paying down tech-debt and how it's not bad at it's nature, but
it's bad.

---

> The solutions all are simple—after you have arrived at them. But they’re
> simple only when you know already what they are.

???
A brutal thing about this gig is solving a problem and not feeling proud of
distilling down because your solution appears simple. Despite the fact that that
is a hard thing to pull off.

on why make angular look like java?

I'm not a fan of how angular makes typescript to look like java. I like the bits
of javascript that don't look like java best :D
